You are to compare Random Forests with 100 classifiers to JRIP on the Iris data to see if there is a statistically significant difference in accuracy.  The file below has the results from 10, 10 fold CV's and you are to use the corrected resampled T-test.

If you do not remember the lecture on this topic,  please look at the file CorrectedResampledTtest.pdf under course files.

Give us the value you calculate and whether the difference is significant for alpha=0.05.
